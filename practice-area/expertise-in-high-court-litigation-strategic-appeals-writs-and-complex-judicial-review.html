                When a matter ascends to the High Court, the stakes are profoundly high, demanding a superior level of
                legal acumen and advocacy. Our dedicated High Court practice team comprises seasoned litigators with
                extensive experience arguing before Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka. The team is headed by Advocate Saji
                P John who is seasoned in handling corporate matters with an experience of 25+ Years. We craft and
                execute sophisticated legal strategies designed to protect your rights, challenge erroneous judgments,
                and secure precedent-setting outcomes. We recognize that success often starts with a perfectly drafted
                petition which are concise, legally sound, and persuasive written submissions that clearly articulate
                the legal questions and remedy sought. SPJ Legal has been contesting various Writ petitions and Company
                Petitions before the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka with a special emphasis to corporate side. The firm
                is handling considerable number of cases regarding winding up of companies and Insolvency Proceedings in
                the High Court. SPJ Legal was appointed as Special Counsels for revival of Government Companies which
                eventually became landmark judgements.

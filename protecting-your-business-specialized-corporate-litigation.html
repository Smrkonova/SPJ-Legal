              <p>Our firm specializes exclusively in matters adjudicated under the Companies Act,
                including highly complex and time-sensitive corporate conflicts. Our Corporate
                Litigation Team is regular before NCLT and NCLATs in filing and defending Petitions
                concerning acts of oppression and mismanagement in a Company including minority
                shareholder litigations and Class Action suits covered under Section 241-246 of the
                Companies Act, 2013. We also address claims of corporate mismanagement, diversion of
                funds, and breach of fiduciary duties by Directors. Pursuant to this, we have
                successfully obtained Orders including the removal of Directors, removal of deadlock,
                setting aside unlawful corporate actions or buyout of shares on a case-to-case basis.
                Shareholder Disputes related to share transfer, rectification of the Register of Members
                (Section 58 & 59), and enforcement of shareholder agreements are also covered in the
                scope of our litigation expertise. We Defend Directors and key managerial personnel
                (KMPs) against allegations of statutory contravention or fraud as well as addresses
                disqualification of Directors, compounding of offenses, Restoration of Company (Sec
                252), Investigation into the affairs of Company (Sec 213). We ascertain the provision
                under the Act that fits for the case and relief and tailor the Draft in consultation
                with the Clients and advocate for your case before the NCLT and NCLAT.</p>

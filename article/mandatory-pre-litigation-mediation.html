              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>The Indian legal landscape has witnessed a paradigm shift in commercial dispute resolution with the
                Supreme Court's emphasis on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms. The introduction of
                mandatory pre-litigation mediation under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 represents a
                fundamental change in how commercial disputes must be approached, prioritizing amicable settlement over
                adversarial litigation.</p>
              <p>This transformative approach is reshaping the way businesses handle conflicts, offering opportunities
                for faster, more cost-effective resolution while reducing the burden on India's judicial system.
                Understanding and adapting to this new requirement is crucial for businesses seeking to protect their
                interests while maintaining commercial relationships.</p>

            <div class="practice__cont">
              <h3>Understanding Section 12A: The Legal Framework
              </h3>
              <p>Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 mandates that commercial suits not contemplating urgent
                interim relief must be preceded by pre-institution mediation. This requirement is not merely procedural
                but substantive, with significant consequences for non-compliance.
              </p>
              <h4>Key Provisions:
              </h4>
              <p><span>Mandatory Nature:</span> Pre-institution mediation is compulsory, not optional, for specified
                commercial disputes.</p>
              <p><span>Scope of Application:</span> Applies to all commercial suits except those seeking urgent interim
                relief or other specifically exempted matters.</p>

                Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908.</p>
              <p><span>Documentation Requirements:</span> Parties must demonstrate good faith participation in mediation
